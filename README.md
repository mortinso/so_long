# so_long

This is my rendition of the "so_long"(__120%__), a 42 project in which:
<table>
  <td>
		You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any character, any collectible and any place you want.
  </td>
</table>
I took <b>HEAVY</b> inspiration from Pokemon games that I played as a kid. All sprites were downloaded from <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/">Spriters Resource</a> and edited/scaled to meet my requirements.

#### Games used:
* Pokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green
* Pokemon Emerald
* Pokemon Diamond/Pearl
* Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver
